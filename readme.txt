Ask where your new customers come from at checkout.

== Description ==
This small plugin makes it possible to ask your customers where they came from at checkout. You can have a look in your Google Analytics, but it's easier (and more correct) to ask your customers where they came from by asking one question: "Where did you hear about us?".

Current features:

* Define your own question
* Set referral locations
* Saves the location at the customer profile
* WPML compatible


= WPML compatible =
This plugin is WPML compatible. Multilingual shops can now ask where they came from in the language of the customer.
